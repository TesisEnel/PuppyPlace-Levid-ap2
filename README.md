Puppy Place is an innovative Android application designed to connect potential pet owners with adorable dogs available for adoption. This user-friendly app provides a comprehensive platform where users can access detailed information about each dog, schedule appointments with the shelter, and create a personalized profile to enhance their experience.

With Puppy Place, finding your perfect furry companion has never been easier. The app showcases a wide variety of dogs, each with their own unique story and characteristics. From playful puppies to loyal senior dogs, there is a match for every dog lover.

One of the standout features of Puppy Place is the ability to schedule appointments with the shelter directly through the app. By creating a user account, individuals can seamlessly book visits and receive updates on their appointments. This convenient feature ensures a smooth adoption process and allows users to establish a closer relationship with the app.

Additionally, Puppy Place allows users to mark their favorite dogs with a heart symbol, creating a personalized list of favorites. This feature enables users to easily keep track of the dogs they are most interested in and simplifies the decision-making process when it comes to adoption.

Overall, Puppy Place is a valuable tool for both dog enthusiasts and animal shelters alike. By providing a user-friendly interface, detailed information about each dog, appointment scheduling capabilities, and a personalized favorites list, this app revolutionizes the adoption process and enhances the connection between potential pet owners and their future furry friends.

## How did the idea come about?
The Puppy Place project was born as a proposed idea for the final project of the "Programación Aplicada II" at the Universidad Católica Nordestana. It has been fully developed by my colleague Greilyn Polanco and myself, Levid Tejada.

Throughout a period of approximately 3 weeks, we went through the entire software development process. This included system analysis and the identification of the entities involved, followed by the design of the screens that would guide our development efforts. Currently, we are still in the coding phase, continuously working on the project.

To ensure the proper functioning of the app, we had to handle all the backend work. This involved creating a private API using the .NET framework, specifically with C#. We made sure to include all the necessary components to meet our requirements.

Additionally, we focused on the frontend development, which was entirely done using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. This allowed us to create a user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience.

In summary, Puppy Place is a project that has undergone a comprehensive development process, encompassing both backend and frontend work. We are confident that our efforts will result in a successful and impactful application.
